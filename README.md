# Angular-9-Masterclass-with-TypeScript-Firebase-Material
These are the scripts that were created following a Udemy masterclass course.
There are two main directories (at the moment).
my-shiny-new-angular-app is the first one. It was created using:
```ng new my-shiny-new-angular-app
To run it, you can use:
```ng serve

The second directory is Course, and it contains a node project that uses typescript. In order to create this project, the command that was used was:
```npm init
In order to run it, you can use:
```npm start
Keep in mind that this will look at the actions found in the package.json file.
